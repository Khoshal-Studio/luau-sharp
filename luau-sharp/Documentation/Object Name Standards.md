# Naming Standards
In C# and other languages, naming standards are used to define how names should be formatted. This includes the use of capitalization, underscores, and other conventions. In L#, naming standards are used to define how names should be formatted in the language. This includes the use of capitalization, underscores, and other conventions. Naming standards are important because they help make code more readable and maintainable. By following a consistent naming standard, developers can easily understand the purpose of a variable, function, or class.

## Language Requirements
- Unique names: Names must be unique within the scope in which they are defined.
- Case sensitivity: Names are case-sensitive.
- Reserved words: Names cannot be the same as reserved words.
- Begin with a letter or underscore: Names must begin with a letter or underscore.
- Contain only letters, numbers, and underscores: Names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- No spaces: Names cannot contain spaces.
- No special characters: Names cannot contain special characters.

## Naming Conventions
- PascalCase: The first letter of each word is capitalized. This is used for class names, method names, and property names.
- camelCase: The first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized. This is used for variable names and parameter names.
- UPPER_CASE: All letters are capitalized, and words are separated by underscores. This is used for constants.
- _underscore: The name begins with an underscore. This is used for private fields and private methods.

## Examples
### Classes
```lua
class 'Person' {
    public.string 'Name';
    -- in years
    public.uint 'Age';
}
```
